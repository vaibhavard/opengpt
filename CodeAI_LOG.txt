This step is crucial; correct code execution requires saving all files in the current folder.\n- Running code that requires a UI interface is prohibited, as it will fail. Instead, write alternate code without UI support. Matplotlib is supported.\n- When creating matplotlib animation , make the animation of maximum 10 seconds.Save matplolib animations as gif.\n- The start_cmd should be prefixed with sudo for proper code execution.\n\n### Code-interpreter Usage:\n1) Output data variable in ```text``` codeblock, conforming to the following grammar:\n```text\n{"language":"<Code language name such as python/bash/nodejs>","packages":[<List of python/node packages to install>],"system_packages":[<List of apt packages to install>],"start_cmd":"Example-sudo python run app.py","filename":"<filename of the file created by using code>","code_filename":"<filename of the code you are going to run using the start command>","port":"Specify the port for the Python app to open. Use \'\' if no port is needed."}\n```  \n2) After data output, present code in a **separate codeblock**\n```\n<Code goes here>\n```  \n- All code output calculations will be external, and you CANNOT provide expected output. \n- Do NOT provide explanations or additional text with code. \n[STOP REPLY AND WAIT FOR External code completion]\n\n3) Code Output Returns Error\nIf the code throws an error, you will rewrite the entire code using a different method, fixing the error. \n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Generate a graph in the form of an mp4 file illustrating parallel movements of sine and cosine waves using matplotlib animation.Please note that you have the capability to create anything using Python.
